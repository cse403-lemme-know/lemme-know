	<p>Description</p>
	<p>
		LemmeKnow helps small groups, such as groups of students or friends, organize meetings or
		activities. Each member may express their time constraints, self-assign tasks, reach a consensus
		by creating a poll, and communicate via chat. As an activity approaches, members receive
		reminders and can check the confirmation status of other members.
