# LemmeKnow

## Description

LemmeKnow helps small groups, such as groups of students or friends, organize meetings or activities. Each member may express their time constraints, self-assign tasks, reach a consensus by creating a poll, and communicate via chat. As an activity approaches, members receive reminders and can check the confirmation status of other members.
