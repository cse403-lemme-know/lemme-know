### Progress and issues

<!--
What you did, what worked, what you learned, where you had trouble, and where you are stuck.

### Plans and goals

<!--
Each bullet point should include a measurable task and a time estimate.

Break down tasks such that lowest level tasks are <3 days.

This is higher level and should indicate who is responsible for each task.

May include long-term goals.

### Mohamad

#### Last week
