#### Progress and issues

- Progress: [#1 Implement Go microservice skeleton](https://github.com/cse403-lemmeknow/lemmeknow/pull/1)
  - Progress: Manually deployed it to AWS
  - Learning: Found a much cleaner way to integrate Go's `net/http` router with AWS API Gateway than I had previously used.
  - Trouble: Had to rely on an `encoding/json` error result, which I consider to be a kludge, in order to decode a JSON message as one of two possible types.
  - Stuck: Was too hard to manually crate API Gateway resources so awaiting Mohamad's `terraform` configurations in order to actually run it.
- Progress: [#2 Add README](https://github.com/cse403-lemmeknow/lemmeknow/pull/2), [#3 Add pull request template](https://github.com/cse403-lemmeknow/lemmeknow/pull/3), [#4 update README](https://github.com/cse403-lemmeknow/lemmeknow/pull/4), [#5 add CODEOWNERS](https://github.com/cse403-lemmeknow/lemmeknow/pull/5), [#6 add template report](https://github.com/cse403-lemmeknow/lemmeknow/pull/6)
  - Learning: How to create a GitHub pull request template and CODEOWNERS file.
- Progress: Helped Daven design database schema.
  - Learning: Researched niche DynamoDB features e.g. `ScanIndexForward = false` to scan a table in reverse.

#### Plans and goals
- Plan: Create backend build instructions (2h)
- Plan: Create skeleton testing infrastructure for backend code (3h)
- Plan: Add API interfaces for known features (4h)
  - Plan: Session managemant (1h)
  - Plan: Chat (1h)
  - Plan: Polling (1h)
  - Plan: Calendar (1h)
  - Goal: API interfaces should be as plausible and practical as possible.
- Goal: Support other members' research or, if applicable, tasks in a timely manner (24h max response time).
