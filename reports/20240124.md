## Team report

### Last week

N/A

### Progress and issues

- Progress: Created Figma UI design.
- Progress: Designed database schema, implemented some access functions.
  - Learning: Gained better understanding of DynamoDB data model.
- Progress: Implemented frontend website prototype (starting screen).
  - Learning: Frontend team learned how to use Svelte.
  - Learning: Distinction between Svelte template (SPA) and SvelteKit template (MPA).
- Progress: Implemented backend microservice skeleton.
  - Learning: How best to integrate AWS API Gateway and Go's HTTP router.
- Progress: Added automated status check for backend.
  - Learning: How to automatically check formatting of Go code.
- Stuck: Running microservice outside of AWS while retaining access to AWS services is tricky (requires additional research/mocking).
- Stuck: Currently unable to integrate backend and frontend due to lack of Terraform configuration (integrating on localhost requires additional research/mocking). Luckily, the deadline for this integration is still in the future.

### Plans and goals

- Plan: Frontend team will build high priority website features (3d).
- Plan: Frontend team will begin implementing REST requests and WebSocket connections (2d).
- Plan: Frontend team will create some form of automated status check for the frontend (1d).
- Plan: Finn will expose backend API interfaces, even if they are not yet implemented (3d).
- Plan: Daven will prepare the database access layer for actual use, and research DynamoDB library more extensively.
- Plan: Mohamad will write a draft Terraform configuration (3d).
- Plan: The corresponding team will write build instructions for each component (1d).
- Goal: Both teams hope to achieve some form of integration (localhost/mocking/AWS) of the backend and frontend (3d).

## Individual contributions

### Brooklyn

#### Last week

N/A

#### Progress and issues
- Progress: Figma Design for Frontend
  - Progress: Worked with team to figure out how we want the final website design to look like
  - Learning: Learned many different techniques in using Figma as a designing tool, such as framing and different layouts
  - Trouble: Lots of going back and forth in editing to produce the final design, so took a lot of patience
- Progress: Converted Design to SvelteKit
  - Progress: created a skeleton svelte file for the login page
  - Learning: learned how to use sveltekit and the difference between svelte and sveltekit
  - Trouble: Had to migrate from svelte to sveltekit because initially didn't realize that svelte doesn't support multi-page websites
  - Stuck: Still working on the redirection of the pages after a mouseclick


#### Plans and goals
- Plan: Polish the login page (1h)
- Plan: Figure out how to render the different svelte pages after a mouseclick (1h)
- Plan: Add skeleton outline to the three different header pages (features, privacy, dev team) (30min)
- Plan: Create skeleton svelte for when user creates the group chat (5hr)
  - Chat screen, menu bar, whenToMeet Calendar, Tasks list
- Goal: finish all the tasks mentioned above

### Daven

#### Last week

N/A

#### Progress and issues

- Progress: Designed and implemented the database schema, and translated it into code in the backend layer.
  - Learning: Increase understanding of how Go's architecture works, it's syntax and coding styles.
  - Trouble: Had trouble with early implementation using Go programming language (no prior experience)
- Progress: Created a database API interface to access and utilize DynamoDB functions (insert, get, delete, update, etc.)
  - Learning: Learn a new comprehensive DynamoDB client library that will be used for our database API layer.
  - Trouble: Had trouble with designing database API interface using Go, still in the learning phase.


#### Plans and goals

- Finished implementing important database functions in the database API layer (4 days)
- Provide clear documentation on the database API layer (2 days)
- Help other member to integrate Terraform & AWS infrastructure into our codebase (2 days)

### Finn

#### Last week

N/A

#### Progress and issues

- Progress: [#1 Implement Go microservice skeleton](https://github.com/cse403-lemmeknow/lemmeknow/pull/1)
  - Progress: Manually deployed it to AWS.
  - Learning: Found a much cleaner way to integrate Go's `net/http` router with AWS API Gateway than I had previously used.
  - Trouble: Had to rely on an `encoding/json` error result, which I consider to be a kludge, in order to decode a JSON message as one of two possible types.
  - Stuck: Was too hard to manually crate API Gateway resources so awaiting Mohamad's `terraform` configurations in order to actually run it.
- Progress: [#2 Add README](https://github.com/cse403-lemmeknow/lemmeknow/pull/2), [#3 Add pull request template](https://github.com/cse403-lemmeknow/lemmeknow/pull/3), [#4 update README](https://github.com/cse403-lemmeknow/lemmeknow/pull/4), [#5 add CODEOWNERS](https://github.com/cse403-lemmeknow/lemmeknow/pull/5), [#6 add template report](https://github.com/cse403-lemmeknow/lemmeknow/pull/6)
  - Learning: How to create a GitHub pull request template and CODEOWNERS file.
- Progress: [#9 Add backend test framework](https://github.com/cse403-lemmeknow/lemmeknow/pull/9), [#11 Add GitHub action which builds the backend](https://github.com/cse403-lemmeknow/lemmeknow/pull/11)
  - Learning: How to automatically check whether a Go codebase is formatted.
- Progress: Helped Daven design database schema.
  - Learning: Researched niche DynamoDB features e.g. `ScanIndexForward = false` to scan a table in reverse.

#### Plans and goals
- Plan: Create backend build instructions (2h)
- Plan: Add API interfaces for known features (4h)
  - Plan: Session managemant (1h)
  - Plan: Chat (1h)
  - Plan: Polling (1h)
  - Plan: Calendar (1h)
  - Goal: API interfaces should be as plausible and practical as possible.
- Goal: Support other members' research or, if applicable, tasks in a timely manner (24h max response time).

### Mohamad

#### Last week

N/A

#### Progress and issues

- Learning: Followed Terraform tutorials
- Stuck: Creating AWS account, sharing credentials

#### Plans and goals

- Write a draft Terraform configuration (applyable but may contain errors) for AWS Lambda, API Gateway, AWS IAM, AWS DynamoDB, and AWS Cloudfront (in that order of priority) for the backend (3d).
  - A Terraform configuration for the AWS Lambda function is in the description here: https://github.com/cse403-lemmeknow/lemmeknow/pull/1
  - Finn can help answer questions about translating architecture into AWS and, by extension, Terraform.
  - AWS DynamoDB configuration should have tables matching Daven's schema.
- Add to it a draft Terraform configuration (applyable but may contain errors) with AWS S3 and AWS IAM for frontend (3d)

### Zohar

#### Last week

N/A

#### Progress and issues

- Progress: Design UI using figma and implement static home page using Sveltekit
  - Learn: Learn how to use figma and Sveltekit
  - Trouble: New to Sveltekit so I took some time to learn it through tutorials and googling.
  - Stuck: No obstacles

#### Plans and goals

- Goals: Work with Brooklyn to complete the static web skeleton
- Plan: Add skeleton outline to the three different header pages (features, privacy, dev team) (2hr)
- Plan: Create skeleton svelte for when user creates the group chat (5hr)
  - Chat screen, menu bar, whenToMeet Calendar, Tasks list
- Plan: Do some UIUX research to determine any other necessary features that frontend needs to implement.
