### Plans and goals

<!--
Each bullet point should include a measurable task and a time estimate.

Break down tasks such that lowest level tasks are <3 days.

This is higher level and should indicate who is responsible for each task.

May include long-term goals.

#### Progress and issues

- Progress: [#54](https://github.com/cse403-lemmeknow/lemmeknow/pull/54), [#64](https://github.com/cse403-lemmeknow/lemmeknow/pull/64), [#72](https://github.com/cse403-lemmeknow/lemmeknow/pull/72), [#79](https://github.com/cse403-lemmeknow/lemmeknow/pull/79), [#82](https://github.com/cse403-lemmeknow/lemmeknow/pull/82), [#94](https://github.com/cse403-lemmeknow/lemmeknow/pull/94) implement (and design, in the case of tasks) backend API's
  - Learning: Go HTTP routing, middlwares, and request contexts
- Progress: [#67](https://github.com/cse403-lemmeknow/lemmeknow/pull/67), [#69](https://github.com/cse403-lemmeknow/lemmeknow/pull/69), [#70](https://github.com/cse403-lemmeknow/lemmeknow/pull/70), [#73](https://github.com/cse403-lemmeknow/lemmeknow/pull/73), [#80](https://github.com/cse403-lemmeknow/lemmeknow/pull/80), [#81](https://github.com/cse403-lemmeknow/lemmeknow/pull/81), [#84](https://github.com/cse403-lemmeknow/lemmeknow/pull/84) test and fix backend API's
  - Learning: how to test HTTP service in Go
  - Issue: when I planned to write unit tests for most of backend, I actually meant integration tests (which is what I did)
- Progress: [#71 write developer guides](https://github.com/cse403-lemmeknow/lemmeknow/pull/71)
- Progress: [#86 write S3 and Route53 Terraform configurations](https://github.com/cse403-lemmeknow/lemmeknow/pull/86) and [#90](https://github.com/cse403-lemmeknow/lemmeknow/pull/90), [#91](https://github.com/cse403-lemmeknow/lemmeknow/pull/91) helped troubleshoot Mohamad's Terraform configurations
  - Learning: new Terraform syntax for policies to avoid embedding JSON in HCL
  - Disclaimer: To the extent that Terraform requires lots of boilerplate and benefits from a few subtle tricks, I used as a starting point Terraform configurations that I personally developed for past (extracurricular) projects. My personal contributions to `terraform/` were primarily customizing it to our needs and improving it, not starting from scratch and conducting original research/implementation. My original research/implementation is focused on `backend/`.
- Progress: [#43 add Dependabot](https://github.com/cse403-lemmeknow/lemmeknow/pull/43)
- Issue: needing to fix broken builds e.g. [#85](https://github.com/cse403-lemmeknow/lemmeknow/pull/85)
- Issue: needing to rush implementation and testing to accomodate last minute integration.

#### Plans and goals

- Plan: Ensure that all applicable API's generate unsolicited notifications (2d)
- Plan: Specify and implement the non-major feature of a tasks API (2d)
- Plan: Write integration tests for the frontend-backend system (2d)
- Plan: Add WebPush notification support if possible (2d)
- Goal: Promptly fix any backend issues experienced by the frontend (1d)

### Mohamad

#### Last week

- Will create a draft Terraform config for AWS Lambda, API Gateway, AWS IAM, AWS Dynamo DB, and AWS Cloudfront
- I plan on reaching out to Finn for help regarding my plans for next week. 

#### Progress and issues

- After speaking with Finn regarding some questions I had about terraform and the AWS services/resources, I was able to have a productive week where I implemented the AWS Gateway API, AWS IAM, AWS Dynamo DB, and AWS Cloudfront. Most of this went smoothly as I was doing research while implementing the AWS features, so I was learning about each resource as I was implementing them. I had some trouble with replacing certain variables with our actual elements since I wasn't sure about what I was supposed to set specific fields of the resources to. I am not stuck anywhere, but as I continue to learn and implement I am sure I will run into something that will stump me and I will have to do more researching or ask Finn. 

#### Plans and goals

- For next week, my task is to incorporate all necessary changes to the Terraform configuration and infrastructure. I believe this will depend on feedback I get from the backend team regarding my implementations that I completed this week as well as the results of the testing that we do. 

### Zohar

#### Last week

- Goal: Complete group create and user create functionality and complete some of the
chat features such as sending messages and receiving messages.
- Plan: Integrate with backend API to create groups in the server
- Plan: Test and update UI for the current dashboard.
