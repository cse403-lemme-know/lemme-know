LemmeKnow is a group activity planning platform with an integrated calendar to show availability and an integrated polling system to help make decisions. It offers a centralized dashboard of who is attending an event, their status, and that of their assigned tasks.

## Goals
- Interactive web-based dashboard
- Calendar, shared between members, showing activities and time conflicts
- Polls, for reaching a consensus based on individual preferences
- Messaging system, for general discussion and coordination
- Reminders, to increase the chance of attendance

## Layout

- `frontend/` contains the frontend website
- `backend/` contains the backend microservice
- `terraform/` contains infrastructure definitions
